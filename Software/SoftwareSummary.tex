    R\&D Technology & Participating Institutes & Description / Concept & Milestones & Future Activities \\
    LCIO & SLAC, DESY & The LCIO software toolkit was developed to provide a common event data model (EDM) and persistency format for Linear Collider physics and detector
    simulations. & & \\
    LCSim & SLAC & The lcsim physics and detector response simulation and event reconstruction
    toolkit was developed at SLAC to provide a flexible and performant suite of
    software programs to allow fast and efficient studies of multiple detector
    designs for the ILC. & & \\
    DD4HEP & CERN & DD4hep provides a generic, consistent and complete detector description, including geometry, materials, visualization, readout, alignment and calibration. It supports the full experiment life cycle: from detector concept development over detector optimization and construction to the operation phase. & & \\
    Marlin & DESY & Marlin is a C++ application framework for processing LCIO event data files. & & Parallelization and adaptation to multi-core hardware \\
    PandoraPFA & Cambridge & The PandoraPFA software package consists of a robust and efficient C++ software development kit (SDK) and
    libraries of reusable pattern-recognition algorithms that exploit functionality
    provided by the SDK. Algorithms have been developed to provide a particle flow
    reconstruction of events in fine-granularity detectors, such as those proposed
    for use at the ILC or CLIC. & & \begin{itemize} \item improvement
    of $\pi^0$ reconstruction \item improve the ability to identify and
    separate neutral hadrons from nearby charged hadrons. \end{itemize} \\
