\subsection{Overview}
Software for the linear collider detector concepts is being in a collaborative effort between the different groups. The groups share a common event data model that allows the exchange and cross-validation of simulation and reconstruction tools. This event data model is implemented in LCIO, the Linear Collider Input/Output file format. The development of LCIO started in 2003 and provides implementations in C++, Java and Fortran.

The software packages are well adapted to studying a variety of different detector models, as necessary for thorough detector optimization studies. The detector description facilitates quick changes to the detector layout, such as different sizes or positions for a given sub-detector. At the same time, it allows the addition of new readout schemes, sensitive materials, or geometries.

Starting from simple algorithms borrowed from previous experiments, the reconstruction packages have been incrementally improved on an as-needed basis, in parallel with improvements to the detail of the detector simulation. They now feature sophisticated strategies and state-of-the-art algorithms for pattern recognition and track and vertex reconstruction, and the most advanced particle flow algorithms available.
