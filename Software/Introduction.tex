\subsection{Introduction}
For the simulation and reconstruction of detectors at Linear Colliders, software was developed to address the following needs of the community:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Studies of detectors with parameters that change frequently.
	\item Development of reconstruction in highly granular calorimeters.
	\item Flavor tagging of b-, c-, and gluon jets.
\end{enumerate}
