        The CMOS pixel sensor uses as a sensitive volume the $\unit[10-20]{\micron}$ thin high-resistivity epitaxial Si-layer deposited on low resistivity substrate of commercial CMOS processed chips. The generated charge is kept in a thin epi-layer atop the low resistivity silicon bulk by potential wells that develop at the boundary and reaches an n-well collection diode by thermal diffusion. &
