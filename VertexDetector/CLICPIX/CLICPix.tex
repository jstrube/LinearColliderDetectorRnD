\subsubsection{Introduction}
To achieve the physics goals of flavour tagging at CLIC, a vertex pixel detector with high spatial precision (3 um single-point resolution), 10 ns time stamping and ultra- low mass (0.2\% X0 per detection layer) will be required.

\subsubsection{Recent Milestones}
\begin{itemize}
\item Development of the CLICpix hybrid pixel readout ASIC with 25 um pitch, analog readout, time stamping, and power-pulsing functionality, implemented in 65 nm CMOS technology
\item Development of ultra-thin (50 um) planar pixel sensors, as well as active sensors with capacitive coupling
\item Low-mass fine-pitch interconnects between sensor and ASIC
\item Through-silicon via technology for powering, configuration and readout of the ASIC
\item Low-mass powering infrastructure, including power-pulsing with local energy storage
\item Low-mass carbon-fibre supports
\item Detector cooling based on forced air-flow
\item Concepts for mechanical integration and detector assembly
\item Detector layout optimisation studies
\end{itemize}
