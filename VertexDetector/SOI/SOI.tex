At present, major issues in the SOI pixel development are ``back-gate effect'', ``hole trap under the transistors by radiation,'' and ``sensor-circuit cross talks'' as shown in Fig. 1. For these, we have been developing a double SOI technology. The developed double SOI wafer has an additional middle-SOI(Si) layer under the transistors. The conduction layer of the middle-SOI can solve all the three issues. We could successfully process the double-SOI wafer (Fig. 2). Threshold shift by radiations is successfully recovered by applying compensating voltage to the middle SOI layer (Fig. 3).
