\subsubsection{Introduction}
\subsubsection{Recent Milestones}
ELECTROMAGNETIC Calorimeter
\begin{itemize}
	\item First development of PFA for dedicated detector (TESLA Report)
	\item First prototype of High granularity electromagnetic calorimeter (``physics prototype'', see publications in the CS report).
	\item First design of ECAL silicon--tungsten for a full scale detector (From TESLA report to DBD 2013)
	\item R\&D on scalable technology for all the involved large detector aspects (integration of embedded readoud chips, on thin supporting electronics boards, in self-supporting tungsten--carbon mechanical elements ensuring the cooling and protection; all made of exchangeable elements with a quality control procedure; the associated DAQ).
	\item Realisation of a large self-supporting W--Carbon fiber structure with integrated stress monitoring (using Fiber Bragg Gratting) 
	\item Recently: tests of 1st base sensor units of the technological prototype in beam
\end{itemize}
PFA:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Development of Mokka an overlayer of the GEANT4 used for ILD, CLIC detectors, CALICE TB, \ldots
	\item Reconstruction tools adapted to the high granularity calorimeters (photon reconstruction [GARLIC], Advanced clustering [ARBOR], event displays [DRUID])
\end{itemize}

ILD integration \& optimisation
\begin{itemize}
	\item for the DBD: integration of all the ILD elements, placement of services, thorough estimation of total cost of the detector
	\item since DBD: re-optimisation of the ILD dimensionning, esp. for the Si-W ECAL using full PFA reconstruction.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Engineering Challenges}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Silicon wafer cost reduction when used for calorimetry; direct contact with producers established (Hamamatsu, On-Semi, \ldots).
	\item A chip with the good dynamic, noise, power dissipation (using power pulsing), etc. 
	\item Integration in a compact device, ensuring all the requests (precision: electronic and mechanic, heat production, reliability)
	\item Industrialisability of solutions; scalability of tests for a 100M channel detector.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Future Plans}
Impossible. No way to see beyond next year (see IN2P3 recommendation)
To recall, all the R\&D will stop at the end of 2016, if there is no decision in Japan
\subsubsection{Applications Outside of Linear Colliders}
\begin{itemize}
	\item CEPC, TLEP and directly today on CMS upgrade
	\item The compact Silicon-W design has been used in the PAMELA satellite (very similar to physics prototype)
\end{itemize}
