\subsection{Introduction}
Two special electromagnetic calorimeters are foreseen in the very forward regions of a linear collider detector, denoted hereafter as
LumiCal and BeamCal.
These calorimeters will deliver both a fast and a precise measurement of the luminosity
and extend the detector coverage to low polar angles,
important e.g. for new particle searches with missing energy signature.
In addition, a LHCal extends the hadron calorimeter to very small polar angles.
Detailed Monte Carlo studies have been performed to
optimize the design of the calorimeters, estimate the background from physics processes and understand the impact
of beam-beam interactions on the luminosity measurement~\cite{2010JInst...512002A}.
A sketch of the design is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Forward_structure}~(left).
To ensure a high efficiency for single high energy electron detection on top of the large and widely spread
background from beamstrahlung, calorimeters with a small Moli\`{e}re radius are needed. Such compact calorimeters facilitate
also the reconstruction of Bhabha scattering events.

  \label{fig:Forward_structure}
\end{figure}
Due to the high occupancy originating from beamstrahlung and two-photon processes,
both calorimeters need a dedicated fast readout.
In addition, the lower polar angle range of BeamCal is exposed to a large flux
of low energy electrons, resulting in depositions up to one
MGy per year. Hence, radiation hard sensors are needed.

\subsection{Mechanical Concept}
Since in both calorimeters a robust electron and photon shower measurement
is essential, a small Moli\`{e}re radius will be preferable.
Compact
cylindrical sandwich
calorimeters using tungsten absorber disks of one radiation length thickness, interspersed with
finely segmented silicon (LumiCal) or GaAs (BeamCal) sensor planes, as sketched in
Figure~\ref{fig:Forward_structure}~(right),
are found
to match the requirements from physics~\cite{2010JInst...512002A}.
LHCal will be designed with a small hadronic interaction length, to fit into the limited space available.

\subsection{Recent Milestones}
Recent milestones were the publication of the performance of fully instrumented detector planes, and the beam-test of a four
sensor-layer stack. The results on the performance are briefly summarized below.
The data analysis for the four sensor-layer stack is still ongoing.

\subsubsection{Currently used Sensors and ASICs}
Large area GaAs sensors, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Calorimeter:FCAL:GaAs}, were developed
and produced in collaboration with partners in industry. The Liquid Encapsulated
Czochralski technology is used. The sensors were
doped by a shallow donor (Sn or Te),
and then compensated  with Chromium.

    \label{fig:Calorimeter:FCAL:LumiCal}
\end{figure}
This results in a semi-insulating GaAs material with a resistivity of about $[10^7]{\Omega m}$.
The sensors are \unit[0.5]{mm} thick with pads of a few mm$^2$ area. The operation voltage is about \unit[100]{V} with
leakage current per pad less than \unit[500]{nA}.

Prototypes of LumiCal sensors have been designed
and manufactured by Hamamatsu
Photonics.
Their shape is a ring segment of 30$^\circ$.
The thickness of the n-type silicon bulk is \unit[0.320]{mm}.
The pitch of the concentric p$^+$ pads is \unit[1.8]{mm} and
the gap between two pads is \unit[0.1]{mm}.
The bias voltage for full depletion ranges between 39 and \unit[45]{V},
and the leakage currents per pad are below \unit[5]{nA}~\cite{eudet2009}.

Dedicated ASICs were designed choosing
an
architecture~\cite{Boie1982365,Gatti:1986qq}
comprising a charge sensitive amplifier and a shaper.
ASICs, containing 8 front--end channels, were designed and fabricated in \unit[0.35]{$\mu$ m} CMOS technology.
A variable gain in both the charge amplifier and
the shaper is implemented by a mode switch. The peaking time of the shaper output signal is \unit[60]{ns}.
More results of the measurements of the performance were published elsewhere~\cite{4600902}.
A dedicated low-power, small-area, multichannel ADC is designed and produced~\cite{6156491}.
It comprises eight 10-bit power and frequency (up to \unit[24]{MS/s}) scalable pipeline ADCs and the necessary
auxiliary components.


\subsection{Test-beam Results}

\subsubsection{Performance of a Fully Instrumented  Detector Plane}

Several test-beam campaigns were done to investigate the performance of single fully instrumented detector planes,
both for LumiCal and BeamCal.
Prototypes of sensor planes assembled with FE and ADC ASICs,
as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:fcal_lumical_module_photo},
were built using LumiCal and BeamCal sensors~\cite{1748-0221-7-01-T01004}.
\begin{figure}[hbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.35\columnwidth,angle=90]{Calorimeter/FCAL/figs/tb3_complete_module}
\caption{Photograph of a fully instrumented detector plane for FCAL.}
\label{fig:fcal_lumical_module_photo}
\end{figure}
The detector plane prototypes were installed in an electron beam and
the trajectories of beam particles were measured by four planes of a silicon strip
telescope.
The front-end electronics outputs were sampled synchronously with the
beam clock, a mode used at the ILC.
\begin{figure}[htpb]

  \includegraphics[width=0.45\columnwidth]{Calorimeter/FCAL/figs/StoN_AmplitudeMethod_TB11} \hfill
  \includegraphics[width=0.45\columnwidth]{Calorimeter/FCAL/figs/hit_map_area1}
  \caption{Left: The signal-to-noise ratio of all readout channels.
          Right: Distribution of the predicted impact points on pads with a color coded signal.}
\label{fig:sinalnoise}
\end{figure}
Data were taken for different pads and also for regions covering pad boundaries.
Signal-to-noise ratios
of better than 20 are measured for beam particles both for LumiCal and BeamCal sensors,
as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:sinalnoise}~(left).
The impact point on the sensor is reconstructed from the telescope information.
Using a color code for the signals on the pads
the structure of the sensor becomes nicely visible, as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:sinalnoise}~(right).
The sensor response was found to be uniform over the pad area and to drop by about 10\% in the
area between pads.

\subsubsection{Preliminary results from a Multilayer Stack}

In two test-beam campaigns at CERN and at DESY a stack instrumented with 4 detector planes was investigated in
an electron and in a mixed particle beam.
Different numbers of uniform absorber plates were positioned in front and in between the detector planes in each
run, allowing to study the longitudinal and lateral shower development.
The data were compared to a GEANT4 simulation. A preliminary result is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:shower_development}.
\begin{figure}[hbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\columnwidth]{Calorimeter/FCAL/figs/long_shower}
\caption{The mean charge read out for an electron shower as a function of the shower depth for data and Monte Carlo
simulation.

\label{fig:shower_development}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Engineering Challenges}
Engineering challenges within the current and future research within FCAL are the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item{A slim assembled sensor plane. The space between absorber planes must be kept as small
as possible. The fan-out to move the signals from the sensor pads to the outside radius must be very thin and
hence a new connectivity technology must be applied.}
\item{Multichannel front-end and ADC ASICs for the prototype.
A compromise must be found between integration, miniaturization and costs}.
\item{Operation using power pulsing to avoid active cooling}.
\item{A dedicated solution for data concentration, data reduction and transmission, allowing read out of
the full calorimeters after each bunch crossing}.
\item{Precise alignment and position monitoring. the inner radius of LumiCal has to be controlled within about \unit[10]{\micron}, and the distance between the
calorimeters on both sides of the IP within \unit[100]{\micron}}.
\item{Montage and demontage of the calorimeters must be done when the beam-pipe is installed. The calorimeters must be segmented at
least in two half cylinders, and corresponding auxiliary mechanics has to be developed.}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Future Plans}

\subsubsection{Radiation Damage Studies}

Two studies Two studies of the radiation tolerance of potential BeamCal sensors have been carried out. The
radiation tolerance of prototype GaAs sensors has been explored by exposing the sensors
to direct irradiation from a high-intensity electron beam of about \unit[10]{MeV}~\cite{sdalinac},
which is an energy expected from beamstrahlung
remnants at the ILC.
It was found that the sensors can be operated at room temperature up
to approximately \unit[1]{MGy} without a significant increase in the
leakage current~\cite{1748-0221-7-11-P11022}; however, significant loss in the response to ionizing particles was observed.
In addition, several different silicon-diode sensor technologies were exposed to varying levels
of radiation induced by the SLAC End Station A Test Beam (ESTB).
For this study, the ESTB test beam, with energies
varying between 3 and \unit[11]{GeV}, was directed into a tungsten beam stop.
The beam stop was split at the depth of the shower maximum
and the sensor inserted,
leading to an exposure incorporating the full spectrum of particle species that will
irradiate the BeamCal sensors. Both n-type bulk oxygenated float-zone and magnetic Czochralski
detectors were explored, with exposures varying from 0.2 to \unit[2.2]{MGy}.
It was found that, after allowing for a short period of controlled annealing,
all sensor types withstood the maximum dose that they received with little loss in response
to ionizing particles~\cite{2014arXiv1402.2692B}, but with some increase in leakage current.
However, the sensors have to be operated at temperatures below -10 \textdegree C.
Further irradiation studies in the ESTB are planned for the future.
The apparatus to measure the charge-collection efficiency  at the Santa Cruz Institute
for Particle Physics is being adapted for the evaluation of pad sensors, which will allow for radiation
damage studies of the prototype GaAs sensors in this realistic electromagnetic shower environment.
Studies to push the silicon diode sensors to higher levels of irradiation are also planned.

\subsubsection{Novel Sensor Materials}

The performance of single crystal Sapphire sensors to detect minimum ionising particles has been studied for the
first time~\cite{1748-0221-10-08-P08008}. Sapphire sensors are a promising alternative for GaAs to instrument
the region near the beam-pipe where a high radiation field is expected.

With Hamamatsu Photonics the design of
edgeless silicon sensors is under preparation. Using edgeless sensors in LumiCal would avoid performance losses
in gaps between sensor segments.

\subsubsection{Mechanical Stack}

A flexible mechanical structure, as shown in  Figure~\ref{fig:mechanical_structure}, has been built as part of the AIDA I project at CERN,
to compose a technological
calorimeter prototype instrumented both with LumiCal and BeamCal sensors.
Tungsten absorber plates, glued on a permaglass
frame, are precisely
positioned on a rod assembly, and interspersed with fully assembled sensor planes.
\begin{figure}[hbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\columnwidth,]{Calorimeter/FCAL/figs/mechanical_structure_2}
\caption{Photograph of the flexible mechanical structure. Tungsten absorber plates, glued on permaglass frames, are put into slots of the
rod assembly.}
\label{fig:mechanical_structure}
\end{figure}
The flatness of the absorber plates is better than \unit[50]{\micron} to allow for highly compact packing of sensor and absorber planes. This stack will be completed
with absorber plates of the necessary quality up to a total thickness of 30 radiation length. JINR Dubna compares the quality
of samples from
different suppliers using a highly precise 3D position measuring device and X-rays.

\subsubsection{Technological Calorimeter Prototype}

Currently the goal of FCAL is to prepare a calorimeter prototype for test-beam measurements. These measurements
are essential firstly to develop and test engineering solutions to build a very compact calorimeter and
secondly to verify the results of Monte Carlo studies. Depending on the test beam
results the calorimeter may be redesigned.
For the prototype calorimeter
a mechanical structure, a sufficient amount of front-end and ADC ASICs, FPGAs for
data concentration and
a data acquisition system are needed. In addition,
two-planes of a pixel tracker in front of LumiCal will be prepared to improve the polar angle resolution.



\subsubsection{Alignment and Position Monitoring }

A laboratory set-up for position monitoring has been constructed by IFJPAN Cracow using semi-transparent
silicon sensors. Test measurements demonstrated that position monitoring with \micron precision is possible.

\subsubsection{Front-End and ADC ASICs}


To match the requirements of extremely low power consumption and taking into account possible radiation
fields in the very forward region, a new development of the front-end and ADC ASICs in deep sub-micron
\unit[130]{nm} CMOS technology has been
pursued within AIDA by UST Cracow.
These ASICs will be sufficiently fast to be used both in LumiCal and BeamCal.
The overall readout architecture, so far successfully produced in \unit[350]{nm} CMOS technology and used in the test-beam
measurements as described above, has not been changed and comprises separated front-end
and ADC ASICs for each readout channel.
\begin{figure}[hbp]
\centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{Calorimeter/FCAL/figs/FE_ASIC.png} \hfill

		 	 Right: ADC ASIC in \unit[130]{nm} technology.}
    \label{fig:ASIC_ADC}
\end{figure}
For both FE and ADC ASICs prototypes, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ASIC_ADC}, are under test.
A dedicated ASIC development is ongoing for BeamCal~\cite{6200898}
with a special option for a fast readout of a reduced amount of
information from each bunch-crossing to be used for a fast feedback system for beam-tuning~\cite{1748-0221-3-10-P10004}.
A prototype of a pixel sensor readout for the pair monitor, positioned in front of BeamCal was designed in SoI
technology~\cite{Sato201153}.


\subsubsection{Data Concentrator and DAQ}
In order to operate a large amount of sensor planes the readout has to be orchestrated.
For this purpose a FPGA based data concentrator is foreseen
which may deliver data in the so called AIDA protocol. The design of this device is currently under discussion.
The higher level DAQ will depend on the functionality of the data concentrator.
For the readout of test-beam data  software is developed, mainly by the University of Tel Aviv,
which can be easily adopted.
For a final device FCAL will follow the developments of a common DAQ for all detectors.
