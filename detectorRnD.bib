	Abstract = {A compact and finely grained sandwich calorimeter is designed to instrument the very forward region of a detector at a future e + e − collider. The calorimeter will be exposed to low energy e + e − pairs originating from beamstrahlung, resulting in absorbed doses of about one MGy per year. GaAs pad sensors interleaved with tungsten absorber plates are considered as an option for this calorimeter. Several Cr-doped GaAs sensor prototypes were produced and irradiated with 8.5--10 MeV electrons up to a dose of 1.5 MGy. The sensor performance was measured as a function of the absorbed dose.},

	Abstract = {The design and performance of a multichannel readout system for radiation detectors are presented. The developed 32-channel prototype system comprises fast, low-noise, front-end followed by a 10-bit multichannel digitizer and on-board FPGA data concentrator, processing the stream of digitized data with up to 6.4 Gbps rate. The operation of the whole system is managed by a microcontroller. The system can work in self-triggering mode or can be triggered externally. The implemented trigger mechanism allows for elaborate event filtering and selection of data to be transmitted to the host through the USB interface. A wide spectrum of measurements showing and quantifying the key system parameters like data transmission rate and event rate, noise, and gain are presented to prove the correct system performance. To increase the power efficiency in experiments with a non-continuous beam structure, a power pulsing mechanism is implemented and verified experimentally.},

@article{6200898,
	Abstract = {The BeamCal detector, one of the calorimeters in the forward region of the International Linear Collider detector, will serve three purposes: ensure hermeticity of the detector for small polar angles, reduce the backscattering from beamstrahlung electron-positron pairs into the detector center, and provide a low-latency signal for beam diagnostics. The BeamCal specifications in terms of noise suppression, signal charge, pulse rate, and occupancy pose unique challenges in the front end and readout electronics design. The Bean-BeamCal instrumentation IC is the integrated circuit under study to fulfill these requirements. To process the signal charge at the International Collider pulse rate, the Bean uses switched-capacitor filters and a slow reset-release technique. Each channel has a 10-bit successive approximation analog-to-digital converter. The Bean also features a fast feedback adder capable of providing a low latency output for beam diagnostic purposes. This work presents the design and characterization of a 3-channel prototype of the Bean built to validate concepts while the final device will comprise 32 channels.},

	Abstract = {The design and measurement results of a multi-channel power scalable 10-bit digitizer ASIC developed for the luminosity detector at the future linear colliders (ILC/CLIC) are discussed. The 8 channel prototype with different modes of output data serialization was designed and fabricated in a 0.35 μm CMOS technology. The ASIC works for sampling rates from about 10 kS/s to 25 MS/s (50 MS/s in single channel mode) allowing linear scaling of ADCs and serializer power consumption (0.8 mW/MS/s ADC core, 1.2 mW/MS/s total per channel). A wide spectrum of static and dynamic measurements confirm very good ADC resolution (ENOB = 9.7 bits), excellent channel uniformity and negligible crosstalk. To profit from non-continuous detector operation in linear collider experiments and to save power consumption, fast periodic power pulsing is implemented.},

	Abstract = {Timepix3 is a newly developed pixel readout chip which is expected to be operated in a wide range of gaseous and silicon detectors. It is made of 256 × 256 pixels organized in a square pixel-array with 55 μm pitch. Oscillators running at 640 MHz are distributed across the pixel-array and allow for a highly accurate measurement of the arrival time of a hit. This paper concentrates on a low-jitter phase locked loop (PLL) that is located in the chip periphery. This PLL provides a control voltage which regulates the actual frequency of the individual oscillators, allowing for compensation of process, voltage, and temperature variations.},

GOSSIPO-4, fabricated in a 130 nm CMOS technology, is a demonstrator ASIC investigating the potential of a new TDC-concept that is based on a chip-wide 40 MHz clock which is complemented by an additional 640 MHz clock. The latter is created upon demand by local oscillators distributed across the pixel matrix. PLL tuning of the local oscillators allows for automatic compensation of frequency fluctuations caused by process parameter, supply voltage and temperature variations. The developed PLL locks within $4~muhbox{s}$ and achieves a duty cycle of 50.75% with a time interval error of only 23.4 ps. Mean DNL and INL of the TDC are less than 20% of the time bin size of 1.56 ns under all anticipated conditions.},

	Abstract = {An eight chip InGrid module has been tested as readout of a prototype time projection chamber. The construction of the modules as well as first preliminary results are presented. The InGrids, a Micromegas like amplification structure with a pixel ASIC, have been produced on wafer-level in a photolithographic process. For the measurements a newly developed readout system based on the Scalable Readout System was used.},

@article{1748-0221-4-11-P11015,
	Abstract = {Due to many favorable properties it is very attractive to use Micro Pattern Gas Detectors (MPGDs) as gas amplification stages in Time Projection Chambers (TPCs). Especially the high granularity, intrinsic suppression of ion backflow, high rate capability and almost no distortions due to E × B effects are desirable in future particle physics detectors. To fully exploit the potential of combining MPGDs and TPCs the pad size in the readout plane should be adapted to the structure size of the gas amplification stage. The Timepix chip is well suited for the use as readout chip in gaseous detector by providing metalized pads to pick up the charge. We have constructed a test chamber with a triple GEM and Timepix readout and a maximum drift distance of 26 cm. With this setup we have studied the performance of the detector in various operation environments. Different setups for tests with cosmic rays and for tests in high magnetic fields have been realized. In these environments key detector parameters such as spatial resolution have been studied in dependence on different gas mixtures. We have seen strong evidence for observation of individual electrons and a spatial resolution of down to 80 μm has been measured.},
