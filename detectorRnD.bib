	Abstract = {For the future e+ e- International Linear Collider (ILC) the ASIC SPIROC (Silicon Photomultiplier Integrated Read-Out Chip) was designed to read out the Analog Hadronic Calorimeter (AHCAL) equipped with Silicon Photomultiplier (SiPM). It is an evolution of the FLC_SiPM chip designed by the OMEGA group in 2005. SPIROC2 [ 1 [http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-0221/6/01/C01098] ] was realized in AMS SiGe 0.35 μm technology [ 2 [http://asic.austriamicrosystems.com/] ] and developed to match the requirements of large dynamic range, low noise, low consumption, high precision and large number of read-out channels. This ASIC is a very front-end read-out chip that integrates 36 self triggered channels with variable gain to achieve charge and time measurements. The charge measurement must be performed from 1 up to 2000 photo-electrons (p.e.) corresponding to 160 fC up to 320 pC for SiPM gain 10 6 . The time measurement is performed with a coarse 12-bit counter related to the bunch crossing clock (up to 5 MHz) and a fine time ramp based on this clock (down to 200 ns) to achieve a resolution of 1 ns. An analog memory array with a depth of 16 for each channel is used to store the time information and the charge measurement. The analog memory content (time and charge) is digitized thanks to an internal 12-bit Wilkinson ADC. The data is then stored in a 4kbytes RAM. A complex digital part is necessary to manage all these features and to transfer the data to the DAQ. SPIROC2 is the second generation of the SPIROC ASIC family designed in 2008 by the OMEGA group. A very similar version (SPIROC2c) was submitted in February 2012 to improve the noise performance and also to integrate a new TDC (Time to Digital Converter) structure. This paper describes SPIROC2 and SPIROC2c ASICs and illustrates the main characteristics thank to a series of measurements.},

	Abstract = {MICRO MEsh GAseous Structure (MICROMEGAS) and Gas Electron Multipliers (GEM) detectors are two candidates for the active medium of a Digital Hadronic CALorimeter (DHCAL) as part of a high energy physics experiment at a future linear collider (ILC/CLIC). Physics requirements lead to a highly granular hadronic calorimeter with up to thirty million channels with probably only hit information (digital readout calorimeter). To validate the concept of digital hadronic calorimetry with such small cell size, the construction and test of a cubic meter technological prototype, made of 40 planes of one square meter each, is necessary. This technological prototype would contain about 400 000 electronic channels, thus requiring the development of front-end ASIC. Based on the experience gained with previous ASIC that were mounted on detectors and tested in particle beams, a new ASIC called MICROROC has been developped. This paper summarizes the caracterisation campaign that was conducted on this new chip as well as its integration into a large area Micromegas chamber of one square meter.},

	Abstract = {HARDROC (HAdronic Rpc Detector Read Out Chip) is the very front end chip designed for the readout of the RPC or Micromegas foreseen for the Digital HAdronic CALorimeter (DHCAL) of the future International Linear Collider and designed within the CALICE collaboration. The very fine granularity of the ILC hadronic calorimeters (1cm2 pads) implies a huge number of electronics channels (4 105 /m3) which is a new feature of ``imaging'' calorimetry. Moreover, for compactness, the chips must be embedded inside the detector making crucial the reduction of the power consumption to 10 μWatt per channel. This is achieved using power pulsing, made possible by the ILC bunch pattern (1 ms of acquisition data for 199 ms of dead time). HARDROC readout is a semi-digital readout with three thresholds which allows both good tracking and coarse energy measurement, and also integrates on chip data storage. The overall performance of HARDROC will be described with detailed measurements of all the characteristics. Hundreds of chips have indeed been produced and tested before being mounted on printed boards developed for the readout of large scale (1m2) RPC and Micromegas prototypes. These prototypes have been tested with cosmics and also in testbeam at CERN between 2008 and 2010 to evaluate the performance of different kinds of GRPCs and to validate the semi-digital electronics readout system in beam conditions. A production of 10 000 chips has been launched in March 2010 to equip 40 GRPC planes (400 000 channels) of a 1 cubic meter detector that will be tested in 2011.},

Short term effects, such as dead time, are studied using consecutive events. On larger time scales, for various beam intensities the chamber's efficiency is studied as a function of time within a spill of particles. The correlation between the efficiency of chambers placed in the same beam provides an indication of the lateral size of the observed effects.

	Abstract = {Today vertically integrated circuits, (a.k.a. 3D integrated circuits) is a popular topic in many trade journals. The many advantages of these circuits have been described such as higher speed due to shorter trace lenghts, the ability to reduce cross talk by placing analog and digital circuits on different levels, higher circuit density without the going to smaller feature sizes, lower interconnect capacitance leading to lower power, reduced chip size, and different processing for the various layers to optimize performance. There are some added advantages specifically for MAPS (Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors) in High Energy Physics: four side buttable pixel arrays, 100\% diode fill factor, the ability to move PMOS transistors out of the diode sensing layer, and a increase in channel density. Fermilab began investigating 3D circuits in 2006. Many different bonding processes have been described for fabricating 3D circuits [ 1 [http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/9783527623051] ]. Fermilab has used three different processes to fabricate several circuits for specific applications in High Energy Physics and X-ray imaging. This paper covers some of the early 3D work at Fermilab and then moves to more recent activities. The major processes we have used are discussed and some of the problems encountered are described. An overview of pertinent 3D circuit designs is presented along with test results thus far.},

	Abstract = {Lepton colliders are considered as options to complement and to extend the physics programme at the Large Hadron Collider. The Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) is an e + e − collider under development aiming at centre-of-mass energies of up to 3 TeV. For experiments at CLIC, a hadron sampling calorimeter with tungsten absorber is proposed. Such a calorimeter provides sufficient depth to contain high-energy showers, while allowing a compact size for the surrounding solenoid. A fine-grained calorimeter prototype with tungsten absorber plates and scintillator tiles read out by silicon photomultipliers was built and exposed to particle beams at CERN. Results obtained with electrons, pions and protons of momenta up to 10 GeV are presented in terms of energy resolution and shower shape studies. The results are compared with several GEANT4 simulation models in order to assess the reliability of the Monte Carlo predictions relevant for a future experiment at CLIC.},

	Abstract = {Calorimeters with a high granularity are a fundamental requirement of the Particle Flow paradigm. This paper focuses on the prototype of a hadron calorimeter with analog readout, consisting of thirty-eight scintillator layers alternating with steel absorber planes. The scintillator plates are finely segmented into tiles individually read out via Silicon Photomultipliers. The presented results are based on data collected with pion beams in the energy range from 8 GeV to 100 GeV. The fine segmentation of the sensitive layers and the high sampling frequency allow for an excellent reconstruction of the spatial development of hadronic showers. A comparison between data and Monte Carlo simulations is presented, concerning both the longitudinal and lateral development of hadronic showers and the global response of the calorimeter. The performance of several GEANT4 physics lists with respect to these observables is evaluated.},

	Abstract = {A prototype module for an International Linear Collider (ILC) detector was built, installed, and tested between 2006 and 2009 at CERN and Fermilab as part of the CALICE test beam program, in order to study the possibilities of extending energy sampling behind a hadronic calorimeter and to study the possibilities of providing muon tracking. The ``tail catcher/muon tracker'' (TCMT) is composed of 320 extruded scintillator strips (dimensions 1000 × 50 × 5 mm 3 ) packaged in 16 one-meter square planes interleaved between steel plates. The scintillator strips were read out with wavelength shifting fibers and silicon photomultipliers. The planes were arranged with alternating horizontal and vertical strip orientations. Data were collected for muons and pions in the energy range 6 GeV to 80 GeV. Utilizing data taken in 2006, this paper describes the design and construction of the TCMT, performance characteristics, and a beam-based evaluation of the ability of the TCMT to improve hadronic energy resolution in a prototype ILC detector. For a typical configuration of an ILC detector with a coil situated outside a calorimeter system with a thickness of 5.5 nuclear interaction lengths, a TCMT would improve relative energy resolution by 6-16\% for pions between 20 and 80 GeV.},

	Abstract = {The studies presented in this paper provide a first experimental test of the Particle Flow Algorithm (PFA) concept using data recorded in high granularity calorimeters. Pairs of overlaid pion showers from CALICE 2007 test beam data are reconstructed by the PandoraPFA program developed to implement PFA for a future lepton collider. Recovery of a neutral hadron's energy in the vicinity of a charged hadron is studied. The impact of the two overlapping hadron showers on energy resolution is investigated. The dependence of the confusion error on the distance between a 10 GeV neutral hadron and a charged pion is derived for pion energies of 10 and 30 GeV which are representative of a 100 GeV jet. The comparison of these test beam data results with Monte Carlo simulation is done for various hadron shower models within the GEANT4 framework. The results for simulated particles and for beam data are in good agreement thereby providing support for previous simulation studies of the power of Particle Flow Calorimetry at a future lepton collider.},

	Abstract = {The energy resolution of a highly granular 1 m 3 analogue scintillator-steel hadronic calorimeter is studied using charged pions with energies from 10 GeV to 80 GeV at the CERN SPS. The energy resolution for single hadrons is determined to be approximately 58\%/√ E /GeV. This resolution is improved to approximately 45\%/√ E /GeV with software compensation techniques. These techniques take advantage of the event-by-event information about the substructure of hadronic showers which is provided by the imaging capabilities of the calorimeter. The energy reconstruction is improved either with corrections based on the local energy density or by applying a single correction factor to the event energy sum derived from a global measure of the shower energy density. The application of the compensation algorithms to geant 4 simulations yield resolution improvements comparable to those observed for real data.},

	Abstract = {The CALICE collaboration is studying the design of high performance electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters for future International Linear Collider detectors. For the hadronic calorimeter, one option is a highly granular sampling calorimeter with steel as absorber and scintillator layers as active material. High granularity is obtained by segmenting the scintillator into small tiles individually read out via silicon photo-multipliers (SiPM). A prototype has been built, consisting of thirty-eight sensitive layers, segmented into about eight thousand channels. In 2007 the prototype was exposed to positrons and hadrons using the CERN SPS beam, covering a wide range of beam energies and angles of incidence. The challenge of cell equalization and calibration of such a large number of channels is best validated using electromagnetic processes. The response of the prototype steel-scintillator calorimeter, including linearity and uniformity, to electrons is investigated and described.},

	Abstract = {An analog hadron calorimeter (AHCAL) prototype of 5.3 nuclear interaction lengths thickness has been constructed by members of the CALICE Collaboration. The AHCAL prototype consists of a 38-layer sandwich structure of steel plates and highly-segmented scintillator tiles that are read out by wavelength-shifting fibers coupled to SiPMs. The signal is amplified and shaped with a custom-designed ASIC. A calibration/monitoring system based on LED light was developed to monitor the SiPM gain and to measure the full SiPM response curve in order to correct for non-linearity. Ultimately, the physics goals are the study of hadron shower shapes and testing the concept of particle flow. The technical goal consists of measuring the performance and reliability of 7608 SiPMs. The AHCAL was commissioned in test beams at DESY and CERN. The entire prototype was completed in 2007 and recorded hadron showers, electron showers and muons at different energies and incident angles in test beams at CERN and Fermilab.},

@phdthesis{figueras:2013PhD,
	Abstract = {The next generation of particle colliders will be characterized by linear lepton colliders, where the collisions between electrons and positrons will allow to study in great detail the new particle discovered at CERN in 2012 (presumably the Higgs boson). At present time, there are two alternative projects underway, namely the ILC (International Linear Collider) and CLIC (Compact LInear Collider). From the detector point of view, the physics aims at these particle colliders impose such extreme requirements, that there is no sensor technology available in the market that can fulfill all of them. As a result, several new detector systems are being developed in parallel with the accelerator. This thesis presents the development of a GAPD (Geiger-mode Avalanche PhotoDiode) pixel detector aimed mostly at particle tracking at future linear colliders. GAPDs offer outstanding qualities to meet the challenging requirements of ILC and CLIC, such as an extraordinary high sensitivity, virtually infinite gain and ultra-fast response time, apart from compatibility with standard CMOS technologies. In particular, GAPD detectors enable the direct conversion of a single particle event onto a CMOS digital pulse in the sub-nanosecond time scale without the utilization of either preamplifiers or pulse shapers. As a result, GAPDs can be read out after each single bunch crossing, a unique quality that none of its competitors can offer at the moment. In spite of all these advantages, GAPD detectors suffer from two main problems. On the one side, there exist noise phenomena inherent to the sensor, which induce noise pulses that cannot be distinguished from real particle events and also worsen the detector occupancy to unacceptable levels. On the other side, the fill-factor is too low and gives rise to a reduced detection efficiency. Solutions to the two problems commented that are compliant with the severe specifications of the next generation of particle colliders have been thoroughly investigated. The design and characterization of several single pixels and small arrays that incorporate some elements to reduce the intrinsic noise generated by the sensor are presented. The sensors and the readout circuits have been monolithically integrated in a conventional HV-CMOS 0.35 μm process. Concerning the readout circuits, both voltage-mode and current-mode options have been considered. Moreover, the time-gated operation has also been explored as an alternative to reduce the detected sensor noise. The design and thorough characterization of a prototype GAPD array, also monolithically integrated in a conventional 0.35 μm HV-CMOS process, is presented in the thesis as well. The detector consists of 10 rows x 43 columns of pixels, with a total sensitive area of 1 mm x 1 mm. The array is operated in a time-gated mode and read out sequentially by rows. The efficiency of the proposed technique to reduce the detected noise is shown with a wide variety of measurements. Further improved results are obtained with the reduction of the working temperature. Finally, the suitability of the proposed detector array for particle detection is shown with the results of a beam-test campaign conducted at CERN-SPS (European Organization for Nuclear Research-Super Proton Synchrotron). Apart from that, a series of additional approaches to improve the performance of the GAPD technology are proposed. The benefits of integrating a GAPD pixel array in a 3D process in terms of overcoming the fill-factor limitation are examined first. The design of a GAPD detector in the Global Foundries 130 nm/Tezzaron 3D process is also presented. Moreover, the possibility to obtain better results in light detection applications by means of the time-gated operation or correction techniques is analyzed too.},

	Abstract = {A major upgrade of the current Japanese B-Factory (KEK-B) is planned for 2015. Together with this new machine (SuperKEK-B) also a new detector, Belle-II, will be operated to fully exploit the planned luminosity of 8 × 10 35 s −1 cm −2 (40 times larger than previously). One of the major changes in the new experiment will be the introduction of a new sub-detector, close to the interaction point, to allow a precise reconstruction of the decay vertices of the B meson systems. This pixel detector, based on the DEPFET technology, will consist of 20 ladder modules arranged in two cylindrical layers around the beam pipe. Each of the modules will be read-out independently by a combination of analog and digital ASICs placed at both ends of each sensor. The digital chip, the Data Handling Processor (DHP), is designed to control the readout chain and to pre-process and to compress the data. The chip structure and the latest results about its performance optimization will be presented.},

	Abstract = {The current-mode ADC chip-prototype for the readout of DEPFET particle pixel-detectors with high spatial resolution is presented. The planned application of these DEPFET detectors are vertex detectors for ILC and Belle II. The chip has 72 ADC channels. Every channel processes the input signals using two cyclic ADCs that operate in parallel. The cyclic ADCs are based on current-mode memory cells. The measured signal to noise ratio of one ADC is about 660 (fast ADC variant: 520) and its conversion time is 320 ns (fast ADC variant: 160 ns) in the case of 8-bit resolution. Redundant signed-digit cyclic conversion is used for automated digital error correction. One ADC-core occupies only 40 {\^A}¿m {\~A} 55 {\^A}¿m, its static power consumption is 0.96 mW. Besides the two ADCs, every channel contains a regulated cascode and two additional current-mode memory cells that allow double-sampling of the input signal. Due to the need for high radiation tolerance, the chip has been implemented in a 180 nm CMOS technology using enclosed NMOS gate layouts. Novel radiation-hard circuits have been used. The chip has also been used to read out a small DEPFET test matrix.},

	Abstract = {The international DEPFET collaboration is developing a silicon pixel vertex detector (PXD), based on monolithic arrays of DEPFET transistors, for the future physics experiment Belle-II at the SuperKEKB particle accelerator in Japan. The matrix elements are read out in a 'rolling shutter mode', i.e. rows are selected consecutively and all columns are read out in each cycle of < 100 ns. One of the major parts in the front-end electronics chain is the DEPFET Current Digitizer ASIC (DCDB). It is now in a close-to-final state. The chip provides 256 channels of analog-to-digital converters with a resolution of six to eight bits. Each converter features an individual dynamic offset correction circuit as well as programmable gain and bandwidth. Several operation modes using single sampling or double correlated sampling are possible. A large synthesized digital block is used for decoding and derandomization of the conversion results. The data is put out on eight 8-bit links, operating at a speed of 400 MHz. Additionally, a JTAG compatible interface is implemented for configuration and debugging purpose. Significant effort was made to reduce the power consumption of the DCDB, since both, voltage drop on the internal power buses and heat sources in the Belle-II experiment are a concern. The chip was realized on a 3.2mm × 5mm die using the UMC 180nm CMOS technology in a multi-project wafer run, provided by EuroPractice. An extra redistribution metal layer with bump bond pads is used, allowing for flipping the chip onto the final all-silicon DEPFET sensor module. Several tests have been performed in order to prove the chip's operation and its quality in terms of noise. The results are presented.},

	Abstract = {Pulsed laser illumination constitutes an excellent tool to emulate the effects produced by the impact of highly energetic particles on electronic circuits. Numerical simulation techniques could be used to study these effects and to establish accurate relationships between the laser parameters and the particle characteristics. Unfortunately, although particle incidence can be accurately simulated, up to now, there not exist a simulation technique able to reproduce completely the effects in electronics produced by a femtosecond pulsed laser. In this paper, we explore the Synopsys Sentaurus TCAD ability to simulate the effects of pulsed laser illumination. Theoretical study of the physics of the laser--semiconductor interactions leads us to design a new simulation tool. Modifying the heavy ion generation rate included in Sentaurus TCAD, we can take into account all the theoretical predicted characteristics of femtosecond laser illumination, and reproduce the single event effects (SEE) found in experimental tests.

	Abstract = {This paper presents a first study of the performance of a novel 2D position-sensitive microstrip detector, where the resistive charge division method was implemented by replacing the metallic electrodes with resistive electrodes made of polycrystalline silicon. A characterization of two proof-of-concept prototypes with different values of the electrode resistivity was carried out using a pulsed Near Infra-Red laser. The experimental data were compared with the electrical simulation of the sensor equivalent circuit coupled to simple electronics readout circuits. The good agreement between experimental and simulation results establishes the soundness of resistive charge division method in silicon microstrip sensors and validates the developed simulation as a tool for the optimization of future sensor prototypes. Spatial resolution in the strip length direction depends on the ionizing event position. The average value obtained from the protype analysis is close to 1.2\% of the strip length for a 6 MIP signal.},

	Abstract = {The design and performance of a multichannel readout system for radiation detectors are presented. The developed 32-channel prototype system comprises fast, low-noise, front-end followed by a 10-bit multichannel digitizer and on-board FPGA data concentrator, processing the stream of digitized data with up to 6.4 Gbps rate. The operation of the whole system is managed by a microcontroller. The system can work in self-triggering mode or can be triggered externally. The implemented trigger mechanism allows for elaborate event filtering and selection of data to be transmitted to the host through the USB interface. A wide spectrum of measurements showing and quantifying the key system parameters like data transmission rate and event rate, noise, and gain are presented to prove the correct system performance. To increase the power efficiency in experiments with a non-continuous beam structure, a power pulsing mechanism is implemented and verified experimentally.},

	Abstract = {The BeamCal detector, one of the calorimeters in the forward region of the International Linear Collider detector, will serve three purposes: ensure hermeticity of the detector for small polar angles, reduce the backscattering from beamstrahlung electron-positron pairs into the detector center, and provide a low-latency signal for beam diagnostics. The BeamCal specifications in terms of noise suppression, signal charge, pulse rate, and occupancy pose unique challenges in the front end and readout electronics design. The Bean-BeamCal instrumentation IC is the integrated circuit under study to fulfill these requirements. To process the signal charge at the International Collider pulse rate, the Bean uses switched-capacitor filters and a slow reset-release technique. Each channel has a 10-bit successive approximation analog-to-digital converter. The Bean also features a fast feedback adder capable of providing a low latency output for beam diagnostic purposes. This work presents the design and characterization of a 3-channel prototype of the Bean built to validate concepts while the final device will comprise 32 channels.},

	Abstract = {The design and measurement results of a multi-channel power scalable 10-bit digitizer ASIC developed for the luminosity detector at the future linear colliders (ILC/CLIC) are discussed. The 8 channel prototype with different modes of output data serialization was designed and fabricated in a 0.35 μm CMOS technology. The ASIC works for sampling rates from about 10 kS/s to 25 MS/s (50 MS/s in single channel mode) allowing linear scaling of ADCs and serializer power consumption (0.8 mW/MS/s ADC core, 1.2 mW/MS/s total per channel). A wide spectrum of static and dynamic measurements confirm very good ADC resolution (ENOB = 9.7 bits), excellent channel uniformity and negligible crosstalk. To profit from non-continuous detector operation in linear collider experiments and to save power consumption, fast periodic power pulsing is implemented.},

It is made of 256 × 256 pixels organized in a square pixel-array with 55 μm pitch. Oscillators running at 640 MHz are distributed across the pixel-array and allow for a highly accurate measurement of the arrival time of a hit. This paper concentrates on a low-jitter phase locked loop (PLL) that is located in the chip periphery. This PLL provides a control voltage which regulates the actual frequency of the individual oscillators, allowing for compensation of process, voltage, and temperature variations.},

GOSSIPO-4, fabricated in a 130 nm CMOS technology, is a demonstrator ASIC investigating the potential of a new TDC-concept that is based on a chip-wide 40 MHz clock which is complemented by an additional 640 MHz clock. The latter is created upon demand by local oscillators distributed across the pixel matrix. PLL tuning of the local oscillators allows for automatic compensation of frequency fluctuations caused by process parameter, supply voltage and temperature variations.

	Abstract = {Due to many favorable properties it is very attractive to use Micro Pattern Gas Detectors (MPGDs) as gas amplification stages in Time Projection Chambers (TPCs). Especially the high granularity, intrinsic suppression of ion backflow, high rate capability and almost no distortions due to E × B effects are desirable in future particle physics detectors. To fully exploit the potential of combining MPGDs and TPCs the pad size in the readout plane should be adapted to the structure size of the gas amplification stage. The Timepix chip is well suited for the use as readout chip in gaseous detector by providing metalized pads to pick up the charge. We have constructed a test chamber with a triple GEM and Timepix readout and a maximum drift distance of 26 cm. With this setup we have studied the performance of the detector in various operation environments. Different setups for tests with cosmic rays and for tests in high magnetic fields have been realized. In these environments key detector parameters such as spatial resolution have been studied in dependence on different gas mixtures. We have seen strong evidence for observation of individual electrons and a spatial resolution of down to 80 μm has been measured.},
