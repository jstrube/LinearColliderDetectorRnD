@phdthesis{figueras:2013PhD,
	Abstract = {The next generation of particle colliders will be characterized by linear lepton colliders, where the collisions between electrons and positrons will allow to study in great detail the new particle discovered at CERN in 2012 (presumably the Higgs boson). At present time, there are two alternative projects underway, namely the ILC (International Linear Collider) and CLIC (Compact LInear Collider). From the detector point of view, the physics aims at these particle colliders impose such extreme requirements, that there is no sensor technology available in the market that can fulfill all of them. As a result, several new detector systems are being developed in parallel with the accelerator. This thesis presents the development of a GAPD (Geiger-mode Avalanche PhotoDiode) pixel detector aimed mostly at particle tracking at future linear colliders. GAPDs offer outstanding qualities to meet the challenging requirements of ILC and CLIC, such as an extraordinary high sensitivity, virtually infinite gain and ultra-fast response time, apart from compatibility with standard CMOS technologies. In particular, GAPD detectors enable the direct conversion of a single particle event onto a CMOS digital pulse in the sub-nanosecond time scale without the utilization of either preamplifiers or pulse shapers. As a result, GAPDs can be read out after each single bunch crossing, a unique quality that none of its competitors can offer at the moment. In spite of all these advantages, GAPD detectors suffer from two main problems. On the one side, there exist noise phenomena inherent to the sensor, which induce noise pulses that cannot be distinguished from real particle events and also worsen the detector occupancy to unacceptable levels. On the other side, the fill-factor is too low and gives rise to a reduced detection efficiency. Solutions to the two problems commented that are compliant with the severe specifications of the next generation of particle colliders have been thoroughly investigated. The design and characterization of several single pixels and small arrays that incorporate some elements to reduce the intrinsic noise generated by the sensor are presented. The sensors and the readout circuits have been monolithically integrated in a conventional HV-CMOS 0.35 μm process. Concerning the readout circuits, both voltage-mode and current-mode options have been considered. Moreover, the time-gated operation has also been explored as an alternative to reduce the detected sensor noise. The design and thorough characterization of a prototype GAPD array, also monolithically integrated in a conventional 0.35 μm HV-CMOS process, is presented in the thesis as well. The detector consists of 10 rows x 43 columns of pixels, with a total sensitive area of 1 mm x 1 mm. The array is operated in a time-gated mode and read out sequentially by rows. The efficiency of the proposed technique to reduce the detected noise is shown with a wide variety of measurements. Further improved results are obtained with the reduction of the working temperature. Finally, the suitability of the proposed detector array for particle detection is shown with the results of a beam-test campaign conducted at CERN-SPS (European Organization for Nuclear Research-Super Proton Synchrotron). Apart from that, a series of additional approaches to improve the performance of the GAPD technology are proposed. The benefits of integrating a GAPD pixel array in a 3D process in terms of overcoming the fill-factor limitation are examined first. The design of a GAPD detector in the Global Foundries 130 nm/Tezzaron 3D process is also presented. Moreover, the possibility to obtain better results in light detection applications by means of the time-gated operation or correction techniques is analyzed too.},

	Abstract = {A major upgrade of the current Japanese B-Factory (KEK-B) is planned for 2015. Together with this new machine (SuperKEK-B) also a new detector, Belle-II, will be operated to fully exploit the planned luminosity of 8 × 10 35 s −1 cm −2 (40 times larger than previously). One of the major changes in the new experiment will be the introduction of a new sub-detector, close to the interaction point, to allow a precise reconstruction of the decay vertices of the B meson systems. This pixel detector, based on the DEPFET technology, will consist of 20 ladder modules arranged in two cylindrical layers around the beam pipe. Each of the modules will be read-out independently by a combination of analog and digital ASICs placed at both ends of each sensor. The digital chip, the Data Handling Processor (DHP), is designed to control the readout chain and to pre-process and to compress the data. The chip structure and the latest results about its performance optimization will be presented.},

	Abstract = {The current-mode ADC chip-prototype for the readout of DEPFET particle pixel-detectors with high spatial resolution is presented. The planned application of these DEPFET detectors are vertex detectors for ILC and Belle II. The chip has 72 ADC channels. Every channel processes the input signals using two cyclic ADCs that operate in parallel. The cyclic ADCs are based on current-mode memory cells. The measured signal to noise ratio of one ADC is about 660 (fast ADC variant: 520) and its conversion time is 320 ns (fast ADC variant: 160 ns) in the case of 8-bit resolution. Redundant signed-digit cyclic conversion is used for automated digital error correction. One ADC-core occupies only 40 {\^A}¿m {\~A} 55 {\^A}¿m, its static power consumption is 0.96 mW. Besides the two ADCs, every channel contains a regulated cascode and two additional current-mode memory cells that allow double-sampling of the input signal. Due to the need for high radiation tolerance, the chip has been implemented in a 180 nm CMOS technology using enclosed NMOS gate layouts. Novel radiation-hard circuits have been used. The chip has also been used to read out a small DEPFET test matrix.},

	Abstract = {The international DEPFET collaboration is developing a silicon pixel vertex detector (PXD), based on monolithic arrays of DEPFET transistors, for the future physics experiment Belle-II at the SuperKEKB particle accelerator in Japan. The matrix elements are read out in a 'rolling shutter mode', i.e. rows are selected consecutively and all columns are read out in each cycle of < 100 ns. One of the major parts in the front-end electronics chain is the DEPFET Current Digitizer ASIC (DCDB). It is now in a close-to-final state. The chip provides 256 channels of analog-to-digital converters with a resolution of six to eight bits. Each converter features an individual dynamic offset correction circuit as well as programmable gain and bandwidth. Several operation modes using single sampling or double correlated sampling are possible. A large synthesized digital block is used for decoding and derandomization of the conversion results. The data is put out on eight 8-bit links, operating at a speed of 400 MHz. Additionally, a JTAG compatible interface is implemented for configuration and debugging purpose. Significant effort was made to reduce the power consumption of the DCDB, since both, voltage drop on the internal power buses and heat sources in the Belle-II experiment are a concern. The chip was realized on a 3.2mm × 5mm die using the UMC 180nm CMOS technology in a multi-project wafer run, provided by EuroPractice. An extra redistribution metal layer with bump bond pads is used, allowing for flipping the chip onto the final all-silicon DEPFET sensor module. Several tests have been performed in order to prove the chip's operation and its quality in terms of noise. The results are presented.},

	Abstract = {Pulsed laser illumination constitutes an excellent tool to emulate the effects produced by the impact of highly energetic particles on electronic circuits. Numerical simulation techniques could be used to study these effects and to establish accurate relationships between the laser parameters and the particle characteristics. Unfortunately, although particle incidence can be accurately simulated, up to now, there not exist a simulation technique able to reproduce completely the effects in electronics produced by a femtosecond pulsed laser. In this paper, we explore the Synopsys Sentaurus TCAD ability to simulate the effects of pulsed laser illumination. Theoretical study of the physics of the laser--semiconductor interactions leads us to design a new simulation tool. Modifying the heavy ion generation rate included in Sentaurus TCAD, we can take into account all the theoretical predicted characteristics of femtosecond laser illumination, and reproduce the single event effects (SEE) found in experimental tests.

	Abstract = {This paper presents a first study of the performance of a novel 2D position-sensitive microstrip detector, where the resistive charge division method was implemented by replacing the metallic electrodes with resistive electrodes made of polycrystalline silicon. A characterization of two proof-of-concept prototypes with different values of the electrode resistivity was carried out using a pulsed Near Infra-Red laser. The experimental data were compared with the electrical simulation of the sensor equivalent circuit coupled to simple electronics readout circuits. The good agreement between experimental and simulation results establishes the soundness of resistive charge division method in silicon microstrip sensors and validates the developed simulation as a tool for the optimization of future sensor prototypes. Spatial resolution in the strip length direction depends on the ionizing event position. The average value obtained from the protype analysis is close to 1.2% of the strip length for a 6 MIP signal.},

	Abstract = {The BeamCal detector, one of the calorimeters in the forward region of the International Linear Collider detector, will serve three purposes: ensure hermeticity of the detector for small polar angles, reduce the backscattering from beamstrahlung electron-positron pairs into the detector center, and provide a low-latency signal for beam diagnostics. The BeamCal specifications in terms of noise suppression, signal charge, pulse rate, and occupancy pose unique challenges in the front end and readout electronics design. The Bean-BeamCal instrumentation IC is the integrated circuit under study to fulfill these requirements. To process the signal charge at the International Collider pulse rate, the Bean uses switched-capacitor filters and a slow reset-release technique. Each channel has a 10-bit successive approximation analog-to-digital converter. The Bean also features a fast feedback adder capable of providing a low latency output for beam diagnostic purposes. This work presents the design and characterization of a 3-channel prototype of the Bean built to validate concepts while the final device will comprise 32 channels.},

	Abstract = {Timepix3 is a newly developed pixel readout chip which is expected to be operated in a wide range of gaseous and silicon detectors. It is made of 256 × 256 pixels organized in a square pixel-array with 55 μm pitch. Oscillators running at 640 MHz are distributed across the pixel-array and allow for a highly accurate measurement of the arrival time of a hit. This paper concentrates on a low-jitter phase locked loop (PLL) that is located in the chip periphery. This PLL provides a control voltage which regulates the actual frequency of the individual oscillators, allowing for compensation of process, voltage, and temperature variations.},

	Abstract = {The direct readout of Micro-Pattern Gaseous Detectors (MPGDs) with bare pixel chips introduces the need for a new generation of readout electronics featuring a high spatial granularity as well as a highly accurate time measurement in each pixel. GOSSIPO-4, fabricated in a 130 nm CMOS technology, is a demonstrator ASIC investigating the potential of a new TDC-concept that is based on a chip-wide 40 MHz clock which is complemented by an additional 640 MHz clock. The latter is created upon demand by local oscillators distributed across the pixel matrix. PLL tuning of the local oscillators allows for automatic compensation of frequency fluctuations caused by process parameter, supply voltage and temperature variations. The developed PLL locks within $4~muhbox{s}$ and achieves a duty cycle of 50.75% with a time interval error of only 23.4 ps. Mean DNL and INL of the TDC are less than 20% of the time bin size of 1.56 ns under all anticipated conditions.},

	Abstract = {GOSSIPO-3 is a demonstrator of a front-end chip designed in IBM 130 nm CMOS in collaboration between Nikhef (Amsterdam) and the Physics Department of the University of Bonn for the read-out of Micro-Pattern Gas Detectors. The prototype features charge sensitive amplifiers, discriminators, a high resolution Time to Digital Converter (TDC), two different Low Drop Out (LDO) voltage regulators for supply voltage control of the Time to Digital Converter, biasing circuits and control logic on a 2 × 1 mm 2 die. The chip can be operated in a time measuring mode or an event counting mode. Following the prototype announcement at the TWEPP 2009, measurement data on gain, noise performance, channel to channel ToT spread and LDO load step responses is now available. The measurement results confirm the high gain and low noise (ENC = 25 e − ) predicted by simulations. Stable and reproducible time bin sizes of the TDC are also confirmed.},

	Abstract = {Due to many favorable properties it is very attractive to use Micro Pattern Gas Detectors (MPGDs) as gas amplification stages in Time Projection Chambers (TPCs). Especially the high granularity, intrinsic suppression of ion backflow, high rate capability and almost no distortions due to E × B effects are desirable in future particle physics detectors. To fully exploit the potential of combining MPGDs and TPCs the pad size in the readout plane should be adapted to the structure size of the gas amplification stage. The Timepix chip is well suited for the use as readout chip in gaseous detector by providing metalized pads to pick up the charge. We have constructed a test chamber with a triple GEM and Timepix readout and a maximum drift distance of 26 cm. With this setup we have studied the performance of the detector in various operation environments. Different setups for tests with cosmic rays and for tests in high magnetic fields have been realized. In these environments key detector parameters such as spatial resolution have been studied in dependence on different gas mixtures. We have seen strong evidence for observation of individual electrons and a spatial resolution of down to 80 μm has been measured.},
