	Abstract = {Timepix3 is a newly developed pixel readout chip which is expected to be operated in a wide range of gaseous and silicon detectors. It is made of 256 × 256 pixels organized in a square pixel-array with 55 μm pitch. Oscillators running at 640 MHz are distributed across the pixel-array and allow for a highly accurate measurement of the arrival time of a hit. This paper concentrates on a low-jitter phase locked loop (PLL) that is located in the chip periphery. This PLL provides a control voltage which regulates the actual frequency of the individual oscillators, allowing for compensation of process, voltage, and temperature variations.},

	Abstract = {The direct readout of Micro-Pattern Gaseous Detectors (MPGDs) with bare pixel chips introduces the need for a new generation of readout electronics featuring a high spatial granularity as well as a highly accurate time measurement in each pixel. GOSSIPO-4, fabricated in a 130 nm CMOS technology, is a demonstrator ASIC investigating the potential of a new TDC-concept that is based on a chip-wide 40 MHz clock which is complemented by an additional 640 MHz clock. The latter is created upon demand by local oscillators distributed across the pixel matrix. PLL tuning of the local oscillators allows for automatic compensation of frequency fluctuations caused by process parameter, supply voltage and temperature variations. The developed PLL locks within $4~muhbox{s}$ and achieves a duty cycle of 50.75% with a time interval error of only 23.4 ps. Mean DNL and INL of the TDC are less than 20% of the time bin size of 1.56 ns under all anticipated conditions.},

	Abstract = {GOSSIPO-3 is a demonstrator of a front-end chip designed in IBM 130 nm CMOS in collaboration between Nikhef (Amsterdam) and the Physics Department of the University of Bonn for the read-out of Micro-Pattern Gas Detectors. The prototype features charge sensitive amplifiers, discriminators, a high resolution Time to Digital Converter (TDC), two different Low Drop Out (LDO) voltage regulators for supply voltage control of the Time to Digital Converter, biasing circuits and control logic on a 2 × 1 mm 2 die. The chip can be operated in a time measuring mode or an event counting mode. Following the prototype announcement at the TWEPP 2009, measurement data on gain, noise performance, channel to channel ToT spread and LDO load step responses is now available. The measurement results confirm the high gain and low noise (ENC = 25 e − ) predicted by simulations. Stable and reproducible time bin sizes of the TDC are also confirmed.},

It is based on the modular Marlin framework for ILC detector development and on the LCIO event data model. The MarlinTPC package consists of more than 50 software modules, providing a flexible tool box for a large variety of TPC applications. It is designed to simulate and reconstruct data from TPCs equipped with conventional pad readout and different kinds of electronics (ADCs and TDCs), taking into account the particularities of micro pattern gas amplification (GEMs and Micromegas).

@article{1748-0221-4-11-P11015,
	Abstract = {Due to many favorable properties it is very attractive to use Micro Pattern Gas Detectors (MPGDs) as gas amplification stages in Time Projection Chambers (TPCs). Especially the high granularity, intrinsic suppression of ion backflow, high rate capability and almost no distortions due to E × B effects are desirable in future particle physics detectors. To fully exploit the potential of combining MPGDs and TPCs the pad size in the readout plane should be adapted to the structure size of the gas amplification stage. The Timepix chip is well suited for the use as readout chip in gaseous detector by providing metalized pads to pick up the charge. We have constructed a test chamber with a triple GEM and Timepix readout and a maximum drift distance of 26 cm. With this setup we have studied the performance of the detector in various operation environments. Different setups for tests with cosmic rays and for tests in high magnetic fields have been realized. In these environments key detector parameters such as spatial resolution have been studied in dependence on different gas mixtures. We have seen strong evidence for observation of individual electrons and a spatial resolution of down to 80 μm has been measured.},
